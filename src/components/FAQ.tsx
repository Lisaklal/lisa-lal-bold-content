      question: "How does it work?",
      answer: "Simple! We discuss your project, I create the content, you review and request changes (up to 10 revisions), and then I deliver the final files. The whole process is designed to be smooth and collaborative."
    },
    {
      question: "How many reviewing chances will I get?",
      answer: "As many as 10 revisions."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of designer are you?",
      answer: "One who balances precision with playfulness. I'm obsessed with clean, intuitive interfaces but also love throwing in unexpected, quirky details."
    },
    {
      question: "What inspires your design style?",
      answer: "Everything from minimalist architecture to street art. I find beauty in contrastâ€”the way simplicity can be bold and complexity can be elegant."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your design process like?",
      answer: "I start with deep research and understanding, then sketch extensively before moving digital. I believe in iteration and always ask 'why' before 'how.'"
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle creative blocks?",
      answer: "I step away from the screen. Sometimes the best solutions come during a walk or while cooking. I also keep a mood board that I constantly update."
