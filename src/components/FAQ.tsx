      question: "What kind of designer are you?",
      answer: "One who balances precision with playfulness. I'm obsessed with clean, intuitive interfaces but also love throwing in unexpected, quirky details."
    },
    {
      question: "What inspires your design style?",
      answer: "Everything from minimalist architecture to street art. I find beauty in contrastâ€”the way simplicity can be bold and complexity can be elegant."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your design process like?",
      answer: "I start with deep research and understanding, then sketch extensively before moving digital. I believe in iteration and always ask 'why' before 'how.'"
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle creative blocks?",
      answer: "I step away from the screen. Sometimes the best solutions come during a walk or while cooking. I also keep a mood board that I constantly update."
    },
    {
      question: "Favorite kind of project to work on?",
      answer: "Anything that tells a story. Whether it's a brand identity or a single poster, I love projects where I can craft a narrative through design."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes you a good collaborator?",
      answer: "I listen more than I talk, ask the right questions, and believe that the best work comes from understanding people, not just pixels."
